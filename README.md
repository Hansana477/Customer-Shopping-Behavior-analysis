Developed an end-to-end data analytics project to analyze customer shopping behavior and generate business insights. Loaded and explored a real-world dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies. Integrated the cleaned dataset into SQL Server, wrote T-SQL queries for aggregation, filtering, and analytical reporting, and connected the database to Power BI to build an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and slicers.
Impact: Improved analytical skills across Python, SQL, and BI tools while delivering actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior.
